\subsubsection{Motivations}
\paragraph{}There is a big risk of a collision with space debris while a spacecraft is operating in LEO. The Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee to the United Nations (section 5.3.2 ‘Objects Passing Through the LEO Region’): “Whenever possible space systems that are terminating their operational phases in orbits that pass through the LEO region, or have the potential to interfere with the LEO region, should be de-orbited (direct re-entry is preferred) or where appropriate manoeuvred into an orbit with a reduced lifetime. Retrieval is also a disposal option.” and “A space system should be left in an orbit in which, using an accepted nominal projection for solar activity, atmospheric drag will limit the orbital lifetime after completion of operations. A study on the effect of post- mission orbital lifetime limitation on collision rate and debris population growth has been performed by the IADC. This IADC and some other studies and a number of existing national guidelines have found 25 years to be a reasonable and appropriate lifetime limit.”
