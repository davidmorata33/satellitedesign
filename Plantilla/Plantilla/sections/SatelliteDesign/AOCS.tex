\subsection{Attitude and Orbital Control Systems}

\paragraph{}Attitude and orbital control subsystem is needed to enable the satellite to keep a specific position within its orbit and to control the antennas in order to remain oriented to assigned area, because the satellite tends to change its orientation due to torque. The AOCS receives telecommands from the central computer and acquires measurements (satellite attitude and orbital position) from sensors. We will also refer to the attitude control as ADACS (Attitude Determination and Attitude control system).
