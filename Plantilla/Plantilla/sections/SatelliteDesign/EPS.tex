\subsection{Electrical Power System}

The Electric Power System of the satellite must provide and manage the energy generated efficiently in order to have all the systems operating under normal conditions. The Electrical Power System of a Cubesat is, probably, the most fundamental requirement of the satellite payload, since a failure of it results in a mission failure.
