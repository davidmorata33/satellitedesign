\paragraph{} Every Astrea satellite (AstreaSAT) of the constellation, needs to communicate to the ground for providing basic telemetry status about its operating status. It could also need to receive commands from the ground to reprogram its software, change attitude or even the orbit. So,  \\


\paragraph{} The telemetry subsytem analyses the information of the ground station and other sensors of the satellite in 	order to monitor the onboard conditions. With this system, the CubeSat is able to transmit the status of the onboad systems to the ground station.
\paragraph{}The command and control subsystem allows the ground station to control the satellite.
